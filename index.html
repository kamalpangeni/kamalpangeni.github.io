	<h2> From Physics to Data Science and Machine Learning ...</h2>	 
<p>
My passion is to use data and analytics to drive operational efficiency, profitability, and quality of patient care. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, stakeholders, and end-users to understand their needs, provide insights, and deliver value. I am always eager to learn new skills, tools, and technologies to enhance my capabilities and expand my knowledge.

<h2>Brief Bio:</h2>

        <p>I am currently working as Senior Data Scientist at CVS Health, I leverage my PhD in Physics and my expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, and Data Analysis to create innovative solutions for complex healthcare challenges. I have over 5 years of experience in developing and deploying predictive models, interactive dashboards, and custom visualizations for various business and clinical use cases.</p>

        <p>I did my doctoral reserach in theoretical
        physics from Washington University in St. Louis where I worked with
        Prof.
        <a href="https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=437524">
            Michael Ogilive</a>
        and Prof.
        <a = href="https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=393111">
            Mark  Alford</a>.
        I did my undergraduate studies in Physics and Mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, UT.
